// Does replacing luxon's zone lookups close the gap to moment-timezone when
// formatting a column of timestamps in a named IANA zone?
//
// Three paths format the same timestamps (see benchmarks/lib/format-paths.ts):
//
//   moment         moment-timezone — packed offset table, no Intl (the baseline)
//   luxon          this fork's src/, unmodified — resolves the zone from Intl
//                  on every value
//   luxon+easytz   the same, with IANAZone#offset and #offsetName sourced from
//                  easy-tz's baked rules instead
//
// The third path is the OUTSIDE view of the problem: how much of luxon's cost a
// consumer can remove without touching luxon, by subclassing the zone. What the
// patches in benchmarks/patches do to the same two lookups from the INSIDE is
// benchmarks/upstream.ts's subject, and the New_York row here is deliberately the
// same measurement that file's table opens with, so the two cross-reference.
//
// Two format shapes, because they exercise different halves of the zone cost:
// `numeric` needs only offset(), while `abbr` also needs offsetName() — which in
// stock luxon constructs a fresh Intl.DateTimeFormat per value, uncached.
//
// Each timing cell reports its fastest pass rather than a median; see
// benchmarks/lib/kernel.ts for why, and for the pass sizing and interleaving.
//
// Speed is only a result if the output matches, and here it partly doesn't:
// luxon's ZZZZ is ICU's short zone name, which outside the Americas and Europe
// is usually a "GMT+3"-style fallback, where easy-tz supplies tzdata's
// abbreviation. That is a behavior CHANGE, not just a faster route to the same
// string, and the --verify sections below are where it is measured rather than
// asserted.
//
// Run: node format.ts            (timings only, ~13s)
//      node format.ts --verify   (+ the output comparisons, ~4s more)
//      bun format.ts             (same, on JavaScriptCore)
